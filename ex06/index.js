let innerHtml = "<p>Click here to <a href='#Home'>return home</a></p>";
console.log(innerHtml); //<p>Click here to <a href='#Home'>return home</a></p>

/* Exemplos

const grouchoContraction = "I've had a perfectly wonderful evening, but this wasn't it.";
const quoteInString = "Groucho Marx once said 'Quote me as saying I was mis-quoted.'";
const allSameQuotes = 'I\'ve had a perfectly wonderful evening, but this wasn\'t it.';

a ideia Ã© usar aspas duplas e simples, no innetHtml, eu vou colocar aspas duplas
em volta da string, na tag a, eu vou colocar aspas simples no href
